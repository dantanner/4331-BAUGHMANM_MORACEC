<span class="style8">The first Ensign on Galveston Bay was launched on
Clear Lake in the Spring of 1963. Spun Sugar (#5) was sailed to its
future home (HYC) by Rufus (Bud) Smith and Tommy Rodgers. With Bud and
Helen Smith's leadership, Ensign Fleet 2 was formed and grew to 28
boats over the next three years. It was not unusual to have 25 Ensigns
on the starting line during the early years of the Fleets history. Over
the years it has remained an active Fleet at Houston Yacht Club and in
the sailing community and 35 boats still call HYC home.
</span><br class="style8">
<br class="style8">
<span class="style8">Fleet 2 is one of 42 active Ensign Fleets in the
United States. The location of the Fleets include Colorado, the Great
Lakes, New England, Mid Atlantic, and Florida. The Ensign Class
Association (http://www.ensignclass.com/) arranges and conducts a
National Championship Regatta each year. The elevated participation in
Nationals (45-50 boats) reflects the increased activity in the Class in
recent years. Membership in the Class Association is at record numbers.
In addition, Ensigns are in production again. The last boats were made
in 1981 and now 20 years later they are being made in Florida.
</span><br class="style8">
<br class="style8">
<span class="style8">The Ensign is a strict one design class that
provides good fleet racing in boats that are very equal and therefore
emphasize tactics. With its large cockpit it also makes a great day
sailer for family outings and day cruises. The Fleet has many social
functions through out the year including an in town party, a downwind
race from Galveston and socializing after races.
</span><br class="style8">
<br class="style8">
<span class="style8">Fleet 2 has been well represented at the National
level. Bud Smith raced in the first two National Championships and
finished second in each one. Clark Thompson Jr. and his team won
National Championships in 1975 and 1976. Clark went on to win the first
Champions of Champions Regatta representing the Ensign Class. Dean
Snider with long time crew of Kay Snider and Frank and Sandy Kelley won
in 1987 and 1988. Then repeated in 1998 with crew of Kay, Dave Lindsay
and Jim Lober and again in 2003 with crew of Kay, Dave Lindsay, and
Simon May.
